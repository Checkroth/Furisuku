Furisuku lessons are held every Thursday from 19:00 to 21:00<br />
For the first hour we speak in English and the foreigners help Japanese with their English skills.<br />
In the second hour we speak Japanese and the Japanese people help foreigners with their Japanese.<br />
After the lesson we go to a nearby restaurant to eat together and talk as a group.
</div>
<div class='content'>
During the lessons, we usually make a pair of one Japanese and one foreigner or two Japanese and two foreigners.
<br />
For the lessons you can talk about anything you want. Many people bring text books or homework to get help for their classes.
There is a topic board at the lessons to help you and your partner keep a conversation for the whole lesson.
